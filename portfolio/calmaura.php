                                  In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. To solve this problem, we have designed out project-"CalmAura" which monitors patient through a armband and then machine learning model will analyze whether a person is suffering from depression or not and this will be displayed on our website among other features.

It is 10-item self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression.</p>

                                <p>Our sole objective was to help people detect mental illness if they have any and then guide them throughout to help them get back to their normal life. People who suffer from depression often lack sleep cycle, appetite, etc.We have developed a device which will monitor the person for two consecutive days on the movement and sleeping patterns. The results are deployed on our website named “Calm Aura” which monitors patients and provide assistance and support to depressed patients mindfulness-based cognitive tasks and activities and other supportive features and functions. </p>
