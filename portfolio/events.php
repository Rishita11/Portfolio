                                As a person and as a professional, I am always eager to learn new things and assist my peers in solving their problems. The best way to do this is to join a community. So far, I've organised two events that have boosted my confidence and given me an opportunity to help others.

        <p class="card-text">As a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, I presented an event titled "How to Become an MLSA and Introduction to Web Development," in which I discussed the various things to consider before applying for MLSA and how to stand out from the crowd. Aside from that, I gave a brief introduction to "Web Development." I explained what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are and how to use them to create a "Login Page." This gave the participants hands-on experience. After a one-and-a-half-hour event, I took the participants' questions and tried to help them in any way I could.</p>

        <p class="card-text">This event was co-hosted by three other speakers: Stuti Mishra, Soumya Singh, and Jaideep Singh. This was a two-day event put on by the <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Superposition Bhopal"</span> chapter.Superposition is an international non-profit bridging the gender gap in STEM through events, chapters, and mentorship. The event's sole purpose was to discuss Open Source and Hacktoberfest. I demonstrated how to create a GitHub account and make your first contribution, as well as how to push code into a repository. It was a fantastic session that taught many students about Hacktoberfest. </p>
